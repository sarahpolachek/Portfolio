            <p>This project was to create a small series of low-fidelity wireframes that walk through a simple workout
                timer app. </p>

            <h2>How you knew it was a problem: was there research or data?</h2>
            <p> Due to the nature of my work being protected by a security clearance, I'm unable to share any of it.
                This project was part of a bi-weekly design challenge assigned by my team lead to our UX team. Although
                it didn't come
                from direct research or data, I'm always searching for a fitness app I really enjoy using. I'm an active
                individual and always enjoy finding new ways to track my
                fitness and the calories I burn during a workout.</p>
            <p> Although there are many fitness apps in the app store, I wanted to create a simple concept that would an
                individual to choose one of their frequent activities, set a timer, and quickly start a workout.</p>

            <h2>The goal for the work: what did success look like?</h2>
            <p>The goal for this challenge was to quickly protoype low-fidelity view only wireframes which included
                visual
                design
                aspects such as color, button shapes, text sizes, and font choices. </p>
            <p>Success for this challenge was to rapidly prototype a simple workout timer that would clearly present
                common workouts, lead to an easy-to-set timer, and allow the user to press start with a button that
                would catch their attention. Once the timer started, the user could see their chosen
                activity displayed, how many calories have been burned, and how much time has passed as well as a visual
                representation of a completion bar. </p>

        <div id="extra3">
            <p></p>

        <div id="extra4">
            <p></p>
        </div>
        <div id="question4">
            <h2>Your role: what did you do, who did you work with, what was your process? How did you drive the team or
                project forward?</h2>
            <p> As an individual challenge, I began with first breaking down what would be the main timer screen when
                the timer was actively tracking the user's time-passed and calorie's burned. After the initial concept
                of this screen, I began brainstorming how the default home screen would appear for the average user and
                what information they would subconsciously want to see displayed. With the idea of designing this with
                the thought of quickly clicking on the app, choosing an acitivty, and starting a timer, I placed four
                main buttons with common activities front and center on the home screen. These button choices could be
                further defined and adjusted within the View Profile section. Further information on previous workouts
                and all statistics would also be displayed below the main section. </p>
            <p> Once an activity is chosen, the next screen pulls up a timer, which when clicked into would allow the
                user to quickly scroll through in 15 minute increments to choose the amount of time they plan on working
                out.</p>
            <p> The third screen seen below, displays pertinent information regarding the time passed and workout
                chosen. The final screen displays a " Finished! Great Job! " message along with a congrats and total
                number of calories burned above. This screen would slowly fade out and back to the default home screen.

            <h2>Your outcomes: Did you solve the problem? How do you know and what did you learn?</h2>
            <p>For the requirements of the design challenge, this project was a success. However, this project is a
                work in progress and one I plan on continuing to develop. I would like to build out more screens and
                to take a deeper dive into how a user would view previous workouts, their overall statistics, and
                their profile. I would like to break down the analytics of their success with completing each timed
                workout and compare burned calories to see how they perform with certain workouts.</p>
            <p>Although meant to be a simple design challenge, I would like to be able to build out the statistics to
                see if the user performs better on certain days of the weeks when compared to what activity they are
                doing and expand this to a weekly, monthly, and quarterly view. It would also be beneficial to take a
                deepr look into the amount of calories burned between workouts. </p>
