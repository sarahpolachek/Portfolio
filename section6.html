            <h3>Question</h3><br>
            <p>Men, women, and children alike feel they would be more confident if they knew a form of self defense
                and
                had more confidence. However, they are worried about being intimidated by a martial arts gym where
                injuries can sometimes be common.</p>
            <p>Many individuals are also consistently looking for a way to get in shape, yet loose motivation to go
                to
                the gym; where they aren't sure what types of exercises will benefit them. </p>
            <p>Jiu Jitsu offers individuals the opportunity to get in shape while learning a self defense.</p>
            <p>Can Jiu Jitsu provide a safe, family-friendly space to train?</p>

            <h3>Finding Data</h3><br>
            <p>Though there are many articles written on self defense and the benefits, it can be an intimidating
                class
                to take or sport to start.</p>
            <p>After interviewing individuals interested in self defense and Jiu Jitsu, as well as parents and their
                children; a prominent concern was the friendless of a dojo and the safety of the individual while
                training there.</p>
