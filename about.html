            <p>Throughout my life, I have always jumped at any chance to be creative. I loved creating greeting
                cards and filling up sketch pads. When it came time to think about furthering my education and what I
                may enjoy doing, it seemed like a no brainer to do something in design. During this time, I found that I
                enjoy making websites and I questioned how I could combine creativity with web design.
            </p><br>
            <p>UX was a new topic to me, when I read about it halfway through my bachelors. It was something that piqued
                my interest. I had received my Associates in Psychology and thought that the field of UX would allow me
                to utilize my interest in people with my love for design. After graduating, I taught myself HTML, CSS,
                and JavaScript; so that I could better my knowledge in design and speak to developers more fluently.
            </p><br>
            <p>Through this journey, I have found myself encompassed in people, businesses, and communities, and the
                heart that beats within each one. I've grown into a person who loves web design and has a growth
                mindset, constantly eager to learn new things. Visually, I love the layout, the organization, and the
                production of how a website will look and function. Technically, I want to dive into the how and why
                behind a users actions and how to best develop the website or application for those actions. Taking a
                visual approach
                through design and content creation is essential to place emphasis on how users will engage with your
                product.</p><br>
            <p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy photography as well as video creation. This gives me the opportunity to piece
                together a story and figure out the best way to present it so that it expresses a question, a feeling,
                or a call to action. I also practice Jiu Jitsu and Muay Thai a few times each week; which helps me
                mentally to stay focused and has only enhanced my ability to work hard and learn from my mistakes. When
                Iâ€™m not doing either of these, I love playing guitar, piano, and baking! </p>
