                <h3 class="faqTitle">Sherpa 6</h3>


                <p class="faqText">My work at Sherpa 6 as an Associate UX/UI Engineer is protected and covered by a
                    Secret
                    Security
                    Clearance. Currently, I am unable to speak upon or display any of my project work. However, I will
                    do my
                    best to provide a brief of the processes I have used.</p>
                <p class="faqText">I help envision the user experience and work to bring an experience to life. By
                    approaching
                    problems with a curious mind, I apply user-focused design solutions to develop functional and
                    effective designs.</p>
                <p class="faqText">The project I am currently working on began with user research and defining user
                    needs.
                    During this
                    process, my team was able to pull together focus group, where we have been able to discuss user and
                    system needs as well as use cases
                    with veterans who have worked in the field before. Using the knowledge gathered within focus group
                    meetings, I work to build out
                    wireframes that display the needs of the user and define the requirements of the system.</p>
                <p class="faqText">I then present the designs to the software team and we discuss the feasibility of the
                    designs and other
                    viable paths for the interface. Once I've reviewed with the software team, I make any necessary
                    changes
                    and then I then decide if a further focus group meeting is needed. This process is repeated until
                    designs are approved and initially submitted for development. </p>
                <p class="faqText"> After wireframes are sent to the software team, I then build out the high-fidelity
                    prototypes that will
                    give the developers exact measurements and definitive flows. I then begin the process again for the
                    next
                    sprint. </p>

            <p>This design challenge was created within a three hour time limit. Its leaderboard layout provides instant
                information on everything from age range, weight bracket, and competitors' rank.</p>
            <p>Users are able to quickly narrow search results to see information on matches won.</p>

            <p>The concept of this app was to create a quick timer that users could use to time their workouts. </p>
            <p>Users have the ability to choose a workout, choose an amount of time for working out, view how much time
                has passed, and how many calories were burned. </p>

            <p>This project cannot be shared publicly, however, I helped build Victorian Finance's internal employee
                website.</p>
            <p>This project was based in Microsoft Sharepoint and was handed off to the company with skeleton
                wireframes. My role in this project consisted of helping fill in and build out each webpage using
                wireframes and css customization. </p>
            <p>The goal was to create a similar look and feel across the site by using branded colors and fonts and
                making sure the placement of content and elements reflected similarly across each page. </p>

            <p>This website was built for a Pittsburgh Coffee Shop, located in Chatham Village of Mount Washington.</p>
            <p>The coffee shop offers vintage, calming vibes and this website was built to reflect the welcoming
                atmosphere that the shop offers. This website also relfects the menu brochure I developed for them,
                which can be viewed on the <a href="bucketVisualDesign.html">Visual Designs</a> page of
                this site. </p>
            <p>The goal of this project was to provide a simple website that would house necessary information such as
                a menu and contact information. Both owners wanted to keep the project small and simple.</p>
