            <p>My work at Sherpa 6 as a UX/UI Engineer is protected and covered by a Secret Security Clearance. I am
                unable to speak upon or display any of my work. However, below is an overview of the design processes
                and methodologies that I have worked through while on a project.
                From understanding the product, researching needs, and analyzing data to designing wireframes and
                testing iterations, the process my team and I utilized for this project rapidly progressed through each
                stage with a deadline of three sprints, six weeks, to present an Alpha demo to our stakeholders. The
                development of this product will continue past our alpha demo, to refine the process and product we
                develop as well as to add more functionality.

            <h3>Understanding and Defining the Product</h3><br>
            <p>Prior to designing, I needed to take the time to understand this product and its needs. Asking the
                question of who our user is, what problem are we trying solve and why we are the ones that can help them
                solve problem? What answers do we hold? </p><br>
            <p>During this phase, we were able to have discussions with stakeholder which played a key role in gathering
                insights about goals and the high-level needs. Using value mapping, we defined what the product is, who
                will use it, and why they need it. This aided in building a strong consensus between teams and
                stakeholders around how the product will match user and business needs. </p>

            <h3>Product Research</h3><br>
            <p>In the following stage, the UX team moved into the research phase. This phase focused on user research as
                well as dissecting and analyzing a legacy app that had once been prototyped but never fully implemented.
                This legacy app was developed with a very similar concept to the application we were building presently,
                however, the app never had the capabilities to be used in the field. </p><br>
            <p>By completing usability testing on the legacy app and analyzing the core functionality, we were able to
                develop an initial overview of necessary functionality that the new application should consider
                implementing. This list helped us in brainstorming new ways to capture the concept of the application
                and how we could best design and implement the necessary functionality. </p><br>
            <p>Our user research also included focus groups of 3-5 target users, where we were able to discuss
                real-world scenarios including current frustrations with how the process was currently being
                accomplished and what would make their job easier. These focus groups encouraged natural dialogue and
                conversation between the focus group, the UX team, and the software team.</p>

            <h3>Analysis</h3><br>
            <p>During the analysis phase, the goal was to move to understanding why the user wants, needs, or thinks
                about the product.</p><br>
            <p>This phase included developing user personas. To note though, it was difficult to speak directly with our
                users since communication is limited with them directly. We were, however, able to develop three main
                user personas based upon seniority. These personas covered each of the users job responsibilities,
                goals, and frustrations. </p><br>
            <p>Creating the user personas in turned helped us develop user stories to further understand how each user
                would use the product. We were also able to utilize focus group sessions to develop a storyboard to
                connect a user persona to their stories about how the product could be used from start to finish.</p>

        <div id="section30">
            <h3>Design</h3><br>
            <p>The design phased pulled together stakeholdersâ€™ expectations and research of the users wants and needs as
                well as user personas and stories. This is the phase where we really begin to piece together the flow
                screen by screen. </p><br>
            <p>The main part of this phase involved creating user flows which worked through each step required in order
                for the user to have a rewarding experience. I then designed low-fidelity wireframes to help visualize
                the user flow and create the main structure of the application which included placement of elements and
                button as well as text placeholders. </p><br>
            <p>Following the approval of the wireframes, I began developing the high-fidelity prototypes. These
                prototypes not only focused on the main interaction and experience but they also included exact pixels
                and dp for developers to reference when programming. During this phase, I also created a design system
                of components and styles (primary and secondary colors, font type, font sizes, icons, and buttons) as
                well as design specifications which included a main icon package for use while programming. </p>

        <div id="section36">
            <h3>Validation (Testing)</h3><br>
            <p>The next phase in our process will be to complete validation testing. This step will help us understand
                whether the design really works for our users. This testing will also help validate the product for both
                stakeholders and end users. </p><br>
            <p>Although we are still in the design phase of our products development and have more sprints to complete
                before we are ready for testing, our testing sessions will be with our focus group, who represents our
                target audience. We plan on beta testing this product as well. During any testing session, we will also
                be paying close attention to the clicks, navigation time, and searches while the app is in use as well
                as the time it takes to complete main tasks. </p>
