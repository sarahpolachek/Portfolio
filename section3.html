            <h1>Building This Portfolio Site</h1>
        </div>

        <div id="section5">
            <p>The goal in creating this portfolio site was to provide a fresh look on my work, to condense my projects
                down to a few of my strongest, and provide a simple, enjoyable, and navigable user experience. I also
                wanted to replace my previous site developed only six months ago.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="section8">
            <h3>Why am I completely redoing my portfolio site instead of just updating my previous one?</h3><br>
            <p>My old site was feeling cluttered. It was one of my first coding projects after finishing a front-end
                development certification. I coded as much as I could into this old site. However, after the feeling of
                accomplishment in coding a few webpages all on my own wore off, I discovered my site had no real goal.
                All my graphic design work, mini-JavaScript Projects, mini UX projects, video work, and photography were
                placed in separate categories on a main project page. Some projects were displayed on the homepage, but
                they certainly weren’t my best projects. </p><br>
            <p>The site was lacking a clear focus. Did I want employers to see my graphic design work first or my UX
                work? Was I trying to show my video work or should I focus on JavaScript? These were all questions I
                wasn’t able to answer when looking at my site. I knew something needed to be done. </p><br>
            <p>So, I set to creating a brand-new site. </p>

            <h3>Research</h3><br>
            <p></p>
            <p>First, I created a site outline. I needed a Work page, which would double as my home page. I needed an
                About page, and I needed to link my resume.</p><br>
            <p>My work page needed to include two to four of my favorite and strongest projects, which would display my
                strengths as a designer and my love for creativity and story-telling. </p><br>
            <p>My about page needed to include text about myself professionally while also including information that
                would give potential employers a look into my life outside of work and how I spend my free-time. </p>
            <br>
            <p>After defining a simple outline of the pages my site as well as the content that would need to be
                included on each page, I had to next look at an over-arching idea of coding methods I would want to use.
                I knew this site wasn’t going to be too complicated. I want to be able to build on it, but initially, I
                needed it to provide the necessary information. I decided the best option would be to use CSS grid to
                develop this site. </p>

        <div id="section24">

            <h3>Wireframing</h3><br>
            <p>With all this information, I moved into Balsamiq and Sketch to begin ideating on the best ways to lay out
                this site. My main goal was to keep it simple and to not clutter it with unnecessary information. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Keeping the CSS grid in mind, I wanted to keep the content in the center of the screen, using two of four
                columns. Information flows downward and it presented similarly on each page. </p><br>
            <p>After figuring out how I wanted to layout out the content, I had to look at color choices. My previous
                sites color scheme was a white background with black text and an aqua accent color. However, I didn’t
                feel as though it exuded me as a designer and didn’t hold the users attention. After some research, I
                decided to go with a dark mode color scheme of dark greys with teal accent colors and white text. </p>
            <br>
            <p>The main benefit that can be enjoyed with a dark mode is the reduced blue light exposure and in turn,
                reduced eye strain that comes from prolonged screen time. </p>

            <h3>Coding</h3><br>
            <p>After I decided on a color scheme in Sketch, it was time to move onto coding. My goal here was to keep my
                code as clean as possible. I wanted to steer clear of unnecessary pages, too many style sheets, and code
                that didn’t read similar from page to page. </p><br>
            <p>I feel I accomplished this mission, with a website that contains only five pages, three of which are
                projects and code that reads similarly from page to page.</p><br>

            <h3>Improvements and Future Goals for this Site.</h3><br>
            <p>My goal is to be able to continue to use this site for future updates with projects. As I continue to
                grow as a designer, this site will need to be maintained to keep projects up to date. </p><br>
            <p>I want to strengthen the code of this site, but learning different method of coding CSS grid, so I have
                more options with page layouts. </p><br>
            <p>I also want to add more interaction with JavaScript and animations to this website.</p><br>
            <p>I want to add in the option to change between a dark mode and a light mode as well. So users are able to
                choose which mode they want to view.</p><br>
            <p>I also want to become a better developer. I am working towards gaining a better understanding in
                JavaScript as well as beginning to learn React so that I am better able to code mobile apps. </p>
