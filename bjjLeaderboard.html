            <h2>The problem you solved: what was this project all about?</h2>
            <p>This project was about creating a leaderboard view that would display information pulled directly from
                previous, current, and upcoming live events within the app. I decided to design a leaderboard that would
                organize brackets and matches that take place during Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Competitions. </p>

        <div id="extra1">
            <p></p>

        <div id="extra2">
            <p></p>
        </div>

        <div id="question2">
            <h2>How you knew it was a problem: was there research or data?</h2>
            <p> During Jiu Jitsu competitions, it can be difficult to quickly find matches taking place and the
                statistics on who is winning, how many points each competitor has earned, and how much time is left.
                Alot of competitions are set up in large gymnasiums, where there could be upwards of 8-10 mats. This
                means that there could be eight matches going on at once. Each mat could have a different age range,
                weight bracket, or ranking.
            </p>
            <p> It can feel like an extreme sport just to find the match you want to tracj. It can also be frustrating
                to try to find where your teammate may be competing, especially if you need to get there quickly to help
                coach them.</p>
            <p> This concept has also evolved to include 'virtual tracking' of competitions statistics. Since the
                beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, many Jiu Jitsu competitions were postponed and the ones that are up
                and running again limit the amount of bystanders and teammates who are not competing that are able to
                attend. This app would help those who can't attend, track their friends matches.</p>

        <div id="question3">
            <h2>The goal for the work: what did success look like?</h2>
            <p>Success for this project was to display a concept of how users could quickly narrow down search results
                of match results and matches happening live. </p>
            <p>With only a few hours to quickly prototype a few wireframes, I wanted to display the overall look of how
                the app would be structured and how it would feel. The app needed to help the user quickly find the
                competition and then choose between previous, current, or future matches. From there they would be
                presented with either completed matches, live matches, or future matchs (and which mats the future
                matches would take place on. The Quick Leaderboard button takes the user to the screen that would allow
                them to quickly narrow down options and filter through men/women, age range, weight bracket, and
                ranking. </p>

            <h2>Your role: what did you do, who did you work with, what was your process? How did you drive the team or
                project forward?</h2>
            <p> As an individual challenge, I began by making a note of the users needs and the
                requirements of the system. As I began wireframing, I continued breaking down and adding to the user
                requirements. I designed the Quick Leaderboard Screen first, as this was the required screen for my
                design challenge and the ultimate goal of designing a leaderboard. </p>
            <p> I then designed the main home page screen and also the active competitions taking place throughout the
                region. The user could then click into the compeition they wanted to view more matches in. </p>
            <p> The following screen would load all live matches automatically, but they could also tab left
                to view previous matches and right to view future matches.

        </div>

        <div id="question5">
            <h2>Your outcomes: Did you solve the problem? How do you know and what did you learn?</h2>
            <p>This design solved the problem for the scope of the design challenge. I broke out user needs, developed
                user requirements, and designed wireframes to display the flow of the design. I would like to build out
                more screens to display more functionality as well. </p>
            <p>It would be cool to potentially integrate this concept with other combat sport competition
                software and scope out the process for building out this app. </p>
